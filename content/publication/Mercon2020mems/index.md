abstract: The design and analysis of a Micro Electromechanical System-based (MEMS-based) Transdermal Drug Delivery System are presented in the research article. A conceptual design for the delivery of Levodopa was proposed by the authors. Major components of the system were identified as a microfluidic pump, microneedle array and the microfluidic channels connecting the system. The working principles of these components were selected according to the persisting requirements and design considerations. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance and to optimize the design of the system. A fabrication method for the system was proposed by the authors as a stacked layer. The results of the simulations conducted were presented. The simulations show positive results with the performance of the system and do not suggest a mode of mechanical failure of the system at the given boundary conditions. The paper concludes with recommendations for future work.
