Bricks are the building blocks of most modern buildings. But with the increasing price tag of building material and the high environmental implications caused by these materials, constructors have slowly moved towards more innovative solutions. Compressed Earth Bricks or CEBs are a better solution for the basic unit of a building, the brick.

Most of us have some idea of conventional bricks in use. Regular or large-sized mud bricks are also called Clay Bricks ("Gadol") molded from clay and burnt while cement blocks are made using a cement aggregate. Mud bricks have existed almost as long as human civilization with the use of dried mud bricks seen as early as 6000-7000 B.C. in ancient Mesopotamian and Indus-valley civilizations. The technology in producing these blocks have barely evolved since these early days of building.

The process of producing both the mud brick and cement block has many environmental implications. These include the damage done to the environment in extracting the required base materials and the high energy cost caused by the firing process in mud bricks. In addition to these issues, these conventional bricks are relatively lower in strength and have lower insulation against heat. These bricks, especially the cement block is not aesthetically pleasing and therefore requires higher additional costs in plastering and finishing tasks.

The CEB is one such solution to these issues. A CEB is simply a brick produced by compressing earth or damp soil into a mold at high pressures[*...*](https://heavenz.lk/articles/tips/what-are-compressed-earth-bricks-cebs/)
