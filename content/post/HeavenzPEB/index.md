Pre Engineered Buildings (PEB), also known as Pre Engineered Steel/Metal Buildings is an upcoming technology used in constructing buildings. Simply put, PEBs are buildings Engineered at the factory and assembled on site. PEBs are commonly known as ‘metal boxes’ or ‘tin sheds’ by laymen, as they are basically rectangular box-shaped structures covered in corrugated metal sheets. Here the components are tailor-made to suit the customer requirement and raw material availability and assembled completely on-site using bolts.

PEB is a cost-effective method of constructing various buildings ranging from warehouses, sports stadiums, train stations or high rise buildings to name a few. PEBs help in constructing low maintenance and cost-effective buildings within short time periods.

There is a considerable difference between conventional steel buildings and PEBs[*...*](https://heavenz.lk/articles/talks/pre-engineered-buildings/)
